3. Project Title
- The Online Food Ordering and Restaurant Management System is designed to provide a convenient and efficient platform for managing restaurant operations and customer orders. This system allows customers to browse the restaurant menu, place food orders online, and track their order status in real time.

Restaurant staff can receive and process orders through the system, reducing manual work and order errors. Managers can manage menu items, monitor sales, and generate reports to support decision-making. The system improves overall service quality, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction by automating the food ordering and management process.
4. Problem Statement
Many restaurants still rely on manual or phone-based ordering, which leads to order errors and delays.

Customers face difficulties in viewing menus, placing orders, and tracking order status efficiently.

Restaurant managers lack a centralized system to monitor orders, sales, and overall performance.

5. Project Objectives
- 
- To design an online system that allows customers to place food orders easily.

To reduce order processing time and minimize human errors.

To help restaurant staff manage orders efficiently.

To provide managers with sales reports and order tracking features.

6. Scope of the System
